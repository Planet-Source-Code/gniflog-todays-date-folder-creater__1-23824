## Todays Date Folder Creater


</div>

### Description

My code creates a folder in route directory of C: named with the local date.(C:\m-d-yyyy) It then copies the contents of three folders(c:\test1, C:\test2, C:\test3) to the C:\m-d-yyyy folder. It does this silently. I made it to deliver an application via novell delivered applications. However, I have found other uses for backing updata. I have commented on every line so you can follow along. Please vote for my code!!!
 
### More Info
 
You will need to create three folders rename the folders test1, test2, and test3 to your own source folder

It takes the local date when it creates the folder. So if your PCs date is off the folder that gets created will be off.

No returns.

No known side effects
